# BarkTracker

## Description

This repository contains the code and resources for my Bachelor Thesis project, a low-cost dog monitoring system that detects barks using artificial intelligence. Developed to improve upon existing sound threshold-based systems, it aims to reduce false positive notifications and offer users real-time monitoring capabilities. The system is composed of two main components: the monitoring hardware setup built around a Raspberry Pi and a mobile application for real-time control and monitoring.

**Software:**
- Raspbian Stretch OS
- Python 3.6 and related libraries (TensorFlow, LibROSA, Numpy, Sounddevice, Joblib, Sauth)
- User space Video4Linux (UV4L) drivers
- Android Device (for the mobile application)

## Installation Guide

### Monitoring System Installation

1. **Hardware Setup:** Gather all the hardware components mentioned in prerequisites.
  
2. **Raspberry Pi Setup:** 
    - Install Raspbian Stretch OS on your Raspberry Pi.
    - Set up Python 3.6 and required Python libraries using: `pip3.6 install librosa numpy tensorflow sounddevice joblib sauth`.
  
3. **Install UV4L Drivers:** Follow the steps detailed in the original installation guide provided above.
  
4. **Setup AI Model:** 
    - Clone this repository.
    - Copy the `bark-detection` folder to the Raspberry Pi's desktop.
    - Navigate to the `bark-detection` folder and run `python3.6 run_model.py` in the terminal. Leave this terminal open.
  
5. **Setup Server:** 
    - Navigate to the `server` folder inside `bark-detection`.
    - Run `sauth --https *USER* *PASSWORD*`. Remember to replace `*USER*` and `*PASSWORD*` with your credentials. Leave this terminal open as well.
  
6. **Port Forwarding:** To access the Raspberry Pi over the internet, refer to the [port forwarding guide](https://portforward.com/router.htm).

### Mobile Application Installation

1. **Download the App:** Download `BarkTracker.apk` from the `user-installation` folder in this repository to your Android device.
  
2. **Installation:**
    - Open the file via the device's file explorer.
    - Enable `Allow installs from unknown sources` when prompted. Remember to disable this option post-installation.
    - Follow the prompts to complete the installation.

3. **App Configuration:** Once installed, open the app and enter the necessary settings that were defined during the monitoring system setup.

## Usage

With both the monitoring system and mobile application installed and set up:

- Use the mobile application to view real-time video and audio.
- Access system settings and check the bark record as needed.
- Adjust system parameters to suit your environment and preferences.
